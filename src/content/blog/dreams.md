> Mysterious shapes, with wands of joy and pain,  
Which seize us unaware in helpless sleep,  
And lead us to the houses where we keep  
Our secrets hid, well barred by every chain  
That we can forge and bind: the crime whose stain  
Is slowly fading ’neath the tears we weep;  
Dead bliss which, dead, can make our pulses leap—  
Oh, cruelty! To make these live again!  
They say that death is sleep, and heaven’s rest  
Ends earth’s short day, as, on the last faint gleam  
Of sun, our nights shut down, and we are blest.  
Let this, then, be of heaven’s joy the test,  
The proof if heaven be, or only seem,  
That we forever choose what we will dream!
