[Nights into Dreams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nights_into_Dreams) is a video game developed by Sonic Team and published by [Sega](https://distantarcade.co.uk/category/sega/) for the [Sega Saturn](https://distantarcade.co.uk/tag/sega-saturn/). Released in 1996, Nights tells the story of Elliot Edwards and Claris Sinclair, who enter a dream world called Nightopia. They travel through the world with the help of a character called Nights and stop the evil Wizeman and his tyrannical destruction of Nightopia.

You control Nights in the game and get to fly around Nightopia, gathering energy so you can ultimately beat Wizeman and save Nightopia and the real world. I remember playing it for the first time at the age of 6 and between the gameplay and the soundtrack, it captivated me like no other game. When I had to go home, I cried so hard because I could still hear the soundtrack in my head but I had no way of playing it again.

The idea of daydreaming, dreams at night, Nights the character, being more productive in the late hours, and the duality of darkness and light are common themes in my life and my work so it was only fitting that I develop them here too.
